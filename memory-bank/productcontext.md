# Product Context: Lumea

## Why Lumea Exists

Lumea is envisioned as a Hebrew-first coaching application. The primary motivation is to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for Hebrew-speaking users, including robust Right-to-Left (RTL) language support from the ground up.

## Problems Lumea Solves

*   Lack of dedicated coaching platforms with a primary focus on the Hebrew language and RTL user interface.
*   Simplifying the complexities of setting up a modern mobile application stack with integrated backend services.

## How Lumea Should Work

*   Users should be able to register and log in via email/password.
*   Users should be able to identify as either a "Coach" or a "Client" during onboarding.
*   The application should dynamically adapt to feature availability based on a feature flag system.
*   Core user interactions should be intuitive and cater to RTL layout principles.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Hebrew-First:** All UI elements, text, and interactions should prioritize Hebrew.
*   **RTL Excellence:** Flawless RTL layout and text rendering.
*   **Simplicity:** Easy-to-navigate interface, straightforward onboarding.
*   **Security:** User data should be handled securely.
*   **Extensibility:** The application should be built with future feature growth in mind.
